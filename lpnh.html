<p>I thought I might put slides here, but I decided slides are dumb for this kind of talk. I mean, who likes slides?</p>
<p>Plus, I'm talking right before drinks. If there's a time you *really* don't want slides, it's while people are waiting for alcohol.</p>
<p>My talk will be extremely quick. Here's what you'll here:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Who I am and why I care about liberty (but for like 10s)</li>
  <li>Why LPNH matters</li>
  <li>Why the FSP matters</li>
  <li>A simple but bold request for LP members</li>
</ul>
